The Graph node in AWS
For this EC2 instance I used  Ubuntu ( Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type )  (64-bit (x86))
with t2.large instace type
as we are running the grah node with cargo it requires 8gb of ram 




For Cost Optimization 

we need to keep four things in mind 
1. Right Size use the right size for resources
2. Reservation (UPFRONT)
3. Elasticity -  Scheduling services of resources )
4.  Track and manage ( analyze the traffic and resources and manage them )
